# Flight Delay Prediction Project

## Project Overview

This project aims to predict whether a flight will be delayed using machine learning algorithms, specifically Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression, and Random Forest. The models are trained on a dataset containing critical features related to flight operations. A flight is considered delayed if the departure delay exceeds 15 minutes.

## Key Features

- **Class Imbalance Mitigation**: Successfully addressed class imbalance challenges to enhance model accuracy and reliability.
- **Model Evaluation and Comparison**: Conducted thorough evaluation and comparison of model performance, highlighting that Support Vector Machine (SVM) demonstrated superior predictive capabilities for predicting flight delays.

## Algorithms Used

1. **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**: Utilized for its effectiveness in high-dimensional spaces and ability to handle class imbalances.
2. **Logistic Regression**: Applied for its simplicity and efficiency in binary classification tasks.
3. **Random Forest**: Implemented to leverage ensemble learning for improved predictive performance.

## Model Training and Evaluation

- **Feature Selection**: Important features were identified and utilized for training the models to ensure robust predictions.
- **Model Performance**: Evaluated models based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score to ensure reliable predictions.
